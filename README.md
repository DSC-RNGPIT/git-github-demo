This repository contains guide to demonstrate the practical demo of Git and GitHub.

### Steps to create a new repository (Git and GitHub Fundamentals - Day 1 Activity)

1. ➕ Create a new repository on www.github.com under your github account. Check the **initialize with readme** option during the creation process.
2. 💻 Now, clone this repository so that you can make a local copy on your PC / laptop.

    ```
    git clone <url>
    ```
    
3. ⌨ After cloning the repo, a folder will be created at location where you cloned the repo. There will be a **README.md** file in this folder. Open the file and make some changes according to your wish.
4. 💾 After you have made your changes, save the file. 
5. 💬 Now add the changes and then commit the changes with an appropriate message.

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "message-of-your-choice"
    ```

6. ✅ Finally, push the changes to the github repository. After pushing the changes, you will be able to look at the changes in the repository that you created in your account.

    ```
    git push origin master
    ```

### 🎉 Congratulations, you just created your first GitHub repository and pushed your first change..!!
